# SQL-PROJECT-

# Analysis of Deforestation and Country Income Groups

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze deforestation trends and income groups of countries using SQL. We will answer several questions related to deforestation, income groups, and other relevant metrics.

# Data Sources
Deforestation data

# Queries and Analysis

1. Find the total number of countries involved in deforestation.

2. Show the income groups of countries having total area ranging from 75,000 to 150,000?

4. Calculate the average total area (in square miles) for countries in the "Upper Middle Income" income group? 
 compare the result with the rest of the income categories.

5. Determine the total forest area (in square kilometers) for countries in the "High Income" income group? Also compare with the other income categories.

6. What are the countries from each region or continent having the highest total forest area??

 # Project Conclusion

There are [TotalCountries] countries involved in deforestation.
The income groups of countries with total areas between 75,000 and 150,000 square kilometers are listed in the results.
Countries with forest areas greater than the average forest area of the "High Income" group are listed.
The average total area in square miles for different income groups is calculated.
The total forest area for each income group is determined and compared.
The countries with the highest total forest area in each region or continent are presented.
